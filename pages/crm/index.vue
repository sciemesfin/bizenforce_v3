                Typically, when people refer to CRM, they are referring to a CRM
                system, a software tool that assists with contact management,
                sales management, agent productivity, and other related
                functions. Nowadays, CRM tools can be leveraged to manage
                customer relationships across the entire customer journey, from
                marketing and sales to digital commerce and customer service
                interactions.

                organization. This includes identifying potential customers,

            Who is CRM for?
          </h1>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            A CRM system is designed to provide everyone in the organization,
            whether it's sales, customer service, business development,
            marketing, recruiting, or any other department, with a more
            effective way to manage external interactions and relationships that
            are critical to success. By utilizing a CRM tool, you can store
            customer and prospect contact details, identify sales opportunities,
            track service issues, and manage marketing campaigns, all in a
            single centralized location. Moreover, every customer interaction
            can be recorded and made available to anyone in the company who may
            require it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            With easy access to data and increased visibility, collaboration
            becomes easier, and productivity can be boosted. By having a
            complete view of how customers have been communicated with, their
            purchase history, payment details, and other relevant information,
            everyone in the organization can work more efficiently towards
            achieving business goals. CRM can be a valuable tool for businesses
            of all sizes, but particularly for small businesses that need to
            accomplish more with fewer resources.

            Hereâ€™s why CRM matters to your business.
          </h1>
          <p class="text-gray-600 py-1">
            The enterprise application software category of CRM is the
            fastest-growing and the most extensive. By 2027, the worldwide
            spending on CRM is expected to reach USD $114.4 billion. To ensure
            the longevity of your business, it is imperative to have a
            customer-centric strategy for the future, powered by the right
            technology. Sales targets, business objectives, and profitability
            are all important, but obtaining accurate, up-to-date information on
            progress can be difficult. How do you convert the numerous streams
            of data coming in from sales, customer service, marketing, and
            social media monitoring into actionable business information?
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 py-1">
            A CRM system can provide a comprehensive view of your customers. All
            of the information is available in one location, displayed on a
            simple, customizable dashboard. This dashboard can present you with
            a customer's previous history with your company, the status of their
            orders, any unresolved customer service issues, and more.
            Additionally, you can include data from their public social media
            activity, such as their preferences, opinions, and comments about
            you or your competitors. Marketers can utilize a CRM solution to
            manage and enhance campaigns and lead journeys with a data-driven
            approach, and obtain a better understanding of the pipeline of sales
            or prospects coming in, making forecasting simpler and more precise.
            You can clearly visualize every opportunity or lead, showing you a
            clear path from inquiries to sales. By embedding CRM in your
            business, from finance to customer services and supply chain
            management, you can gain significant improvements in productivity
            and customer-centricity across the entire company.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 py-1">
            While CRM systems have traditionally been used for sales and
            marketing purposes, customer service and support are becoming
            increasingly vital segments of CRM and managing holistic customer
            relationships. Nowadays, a customer may raise an issue in one
            channel, such as Twitter, and then switch to email or telephone to
            resolve it privately. A CRM platform enables you to manage the
            inquiry across channels without losing track and provides sales,
            service, and marketing with a single view of the customer to inform
            their activities. The ability to link these three functions, and the
            teams that support them, on one platform and with one view of the
            customer, is crucial for providing relevant, connected experiences.

            Running a business without CRM can cost you real money.
          </h1>
          <p class="text-gray-100">
            Increasing administrative tasks can leave less time for other
            important tasks. For example, an active sales team may generate a
            substantial amount of data through their customer interactions,
            which may be stored in handwritten notes, laptops, or the
            salespeople's memories. Unfortunately, this can result in lost
            details, missed follow-ups, and unclear prioritization of customers,
            leading to guesswork rather than data-driven decision-making. The
            problem may be exacerbated if a key salesperson leaves the team.
            However, the negative impact of a lack of customer relationship
            management (CRM) is not limited to sales teams.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-100">
            Customers may contact businesses via various platforms such as
            phone, email, or social media to ask questions, follow up on orders,
            or report issues. Without a centralized platform to manage customer
            interactions, businesses may struggle to keep up with the flow of
            information, leading to slow or inadequate responses. Even if the
            data is collected successfully, the challenge of making sense of it
            can be daunting. Reports may be difficult to generate, wasting
            valuable selling time. Managers may lose track of their team's
            progress, which can prevent them from providing the necessary
            support at the right time. Additionally, the lack of oversight may
            result in a lack of accountability from the team.
